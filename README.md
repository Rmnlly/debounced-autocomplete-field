# Debounced Autocompleting Text Field

In this learning experiment I am using the [scryfall card autocomplete api](https://scryfall.com/docs/api/cards/autocomplete).

The goal was to create an input field which will try to load card names from an API. 
I also implemented a debounce so that the user isn't firing the API constantly.
The whole component is created using hooks.
